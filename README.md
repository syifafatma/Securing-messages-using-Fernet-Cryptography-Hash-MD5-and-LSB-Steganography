Steganography is an art of hiding messages into cover object (in this case we used image) without drawing attackerâ€™s attention. Before the messages embedded to image, messages are encypted with Fernet Cipher method and the fernet key hashed using MD5 encoder. Combination of cryptography (Fernet Cipher method), Hash MD5 function, and steganography (LSB method) increasing security level of messages.
